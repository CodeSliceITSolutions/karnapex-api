            <p>Bandipur National Park, established in 1973 as a tiger reserve under Project Tiger, is a National Park and located in Gundlupet Taluk of Chamarajanagar district. It was once a private hunting reserve for the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Mysore. Bandipur is known for its wildlife and has many types of biomes, but dry deciduous forest is dominant. Bandipur supports a good population of endangered and vulnerable species like Indian elephants, gaurs, tigers, sloth bears, muggers, Indian rock pythons, four-horned antelopes and dholes. Most National Parks in the country hold their individual tiger counting operations almost every year. Census of tigers is taken by studying their pugmarks.
