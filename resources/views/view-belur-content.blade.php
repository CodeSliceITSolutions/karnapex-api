           <p>Chennakeshava Temple, also referred to as Keshava, Keshava or Vijayanarayana Temple of Belur, is a 12th Century Hindu Temple in, Hassan district of Karnataka. The temple was built over three generations and took 103 years to finish. The temple is remarkable for its architecture, sculptures, reliefs, friezes as well its iconography, inscriptions and history. The temple artwork depicts scenes of secular life in the 12th century, dancers and musicians, as well as a pictorial narration of Hindu texts such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas through numerous friezes. It is a Vaishnava temple that reverentially includes many themes from Shaivism and Shaktism, as well as images of a Jina from Jainism and the Buddha from Buddhism. The Chennakeshava temple is a testimony to the artistic, cultural and theological perspectives in 12th century South India and the Hoysala Empire rule. In September 2023, the World Heritage Committee, at its 45th extended Session held at Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, inscribed the Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas, on the List of World Heritage. It is now the 42nd World Heritage Site in India.</p>
