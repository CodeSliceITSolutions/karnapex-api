            The mascot of Karnapex shows the syncretism between culture of Karnataka and the Department of Posts. The Mascot has a painted face seen in Yakshagana and body of Letter box. Yakshagana is a traditional folk dance form popular in Coastal Karnataka districts. Yakshagana â€“ an elaborate dance-drama performance unique to Karnataka. It is a rare combination of dance, music, song, scholarly dialogues and colourful costumes. A celestial world unfolds before the audience, as loud singing and drumming form a backdrop to dancers clad in striking costumes. Hence the name Yaksha (celestial) Gana (music). The letter box is the ever present symbol of the department. During the early British era, green-painted boxes were used. unobtrusive, excessively so. But due to its unobtrusiveness, complaints were received by people having difficulty finding them. This brought in red colour letter boxes in around 1874. The red colour has the highest wavelength and the shortest frequency, which makes it visible even from a distance.
