            The “Stone Chariot”, as it is often referred is the flagship tourist attraction of Hampi. This is not a chariot, as the name suggests, rather a shrine built like a chariot. The Hampi Chariot has earned its name among the other three famous stone chariots in India- One in Konark, Odissa, and the other in Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu). In 1986, Hampi was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. A definitive stamp was released on 15th March 1967, on stone chariot with a price of 70 paisa.
