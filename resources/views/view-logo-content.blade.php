                This is the official logo of the 13th edition of Karnapex, State Level Philatelic Exhibition.
                Karnataka is a place of diverse culture, rich history, and natural beauty. It is known for its
                magnificent architecture, folk arts, and delicious cuisine. The same has been documented through philately.
                The catchphrase “Festival of stamps” justifies the aim of Karnapex completely.
