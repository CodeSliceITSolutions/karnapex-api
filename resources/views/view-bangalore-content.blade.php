           <p>The Bangalore GPO was first established as The Imperial Post Office in 1800 and was elevated to the status of Head Post Office in 1854. Originally housed in a single-storeyed building near Cubbon Park, it has been replaced with a six-storeyed building at the junction of Raj Bhavan Road and Dr Ambedkar Veedhi. Ahead of the World Philatelic Exhibition in January 1989, the Department of Posts brought out two stamps commemorating the Bombay GPO and Bangalore GPO, on October 9, 1988.</p>
