            Gol Gumbaz is one majestic structures which is aptly known as south India’s Taj Mahal. The place consists of the remains of Mohammad Adil Shah, who ruled Bijapur between 1627 and 1656. It is the second largest dome ever built, next in size only to St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. The acoustics of the space is so well crafted that even the slightest of sounds can be heard on the other side, which is why it is called “Whispering Gallery”. A lovely 6-annas stamp was issued on 15th August 1949 featuring this historic beauty.
